# Real-Time Community Pantry Donation App

A real-time donation application inspired by the Community Pantry movement in the Philippines. Built with Express, React, and Socket.IO.

## Features

- Real-time updates of donation cash for all users
- Donate and redeem cash with instant feedback
- Modern, responsive UI with Bootstrap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd Socket_assignment
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the frontend app:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Open your browser and go to:**  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works

- The backend keeps track of the total cash.
- When a user donates or redeems, the backend updates the cash and broadcasts the new value to all connected clients in real time.
- The frontend displays the current cash and provides buttons for donating and redeeming.

## Project Structure

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
